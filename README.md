#my-less
My implementation of the less command to learn the Rust programming language.

##TODO
- line wrapping (currently lines longer than screen width get cut off)
- more navigation
- searching
- command line flags:
  - -n  -N  ....  --line-numbers  --LINE-NUMBERS
- Added better error messages on common errors:
  - opening a directory
- support more than one file
